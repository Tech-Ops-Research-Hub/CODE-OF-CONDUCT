Code of Conduct
Our Pledge
We, as members, contributors, and leaders, pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

Our Standards

Showing empathy and kindness toward other people.
Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
Focusing on what is best not just for the individual but for the overall community.
Offering help and support to beginners and less experienced contributors.
Using inclusive language and avoiding slang or jargon that could alienate others.
Actively seeking to understand others' perspectives.

Unacceptable behavior include:

The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.

Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct. They may also temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Examples of community spaces include, but are not limited to:

GitHub repositories and issue trackers.
Communication channels such as Slack, Discord, or mailing lists.
In-person events, conferences, and workshops.
Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at techopsinc2023@gmail.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
